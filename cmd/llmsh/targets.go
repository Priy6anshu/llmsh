// Where a skill goes depends on which agent is meant to read it.
//
// A skill is a directory -- SKILL.md plus whatever it references -- and the
// agents disagree about where such a directory lives and, more awkwardly,
// whether it is a directory at all. Claude Code reads a tree of them. Cursor
// reads rule files. Codex and Gemini CLI read one project context file each.
//
// So installing for a non-Claude agent is two steps rather than one: the skill
// itself is unpacked somewhere stable, and then that agent is told about it in
// the form it actually reads. Both steps are here, in a table, because the
// alternative is four branches of an if-statement in the middle of a download.
//
// Nothing outside this file knows any agent's name.

// target is one agent's idea of where instructions live.

	// case -- .claude/skills is ~/.claude/skills -- and opencode is why the
	// field exists: its project directory is .opencode/skills and its personal
	// one is .config/opencode/skills, so joining home to Dir would write to
