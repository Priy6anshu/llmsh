// Command llmsh is the LLM SkillHub command line.
//
// It does not replace git and does not try to. A skill lives in a repository,
// and git already gives you diffing, rollback and history on your own machine --
// far better than a registry ever could. What was missing is that the two knew
// nothing about each other, so this reads the repository when publishing:
// refusing to ship uncommitted work by accident, and recording the commit a
// version came from.

const usage = `llmsh — publish and manage LLM SkillHub skills

Usage:
  llmsh init [dir]               scaffold a new skill, asking what the validator needs
  llmsh clone <owner>/<skill>    fetch a skill's source to work on
  llmsh pull                     update a working copy to the newest version
  llmsh checkout <version>       switch a working copy to a specific version

  llmsh validate [dir]           check a skill folder, storing nothing
  llmsh diff [dir]               what you would publish, against what is published
  llmsh publish [dir]            package the folder and submit it for review
  llmsh push [dir]               the same thing, if that is the word you reach for
  llmsh status <skill>           versions, review state and what a reviewer asked for
  llmsh install <owner>/<skill>  download, verify and unpack where an agent will load it

  llmsh login / logout / whoami  the stored access token

Flags:
  llmsh publish --version 1.2.0  override the version in SKILL.md
  llmsh publish --allow-dirty    publish even with uncommitted changes
  llmsh publish --dry-run        validate on the server without storing anything
  llmsh install name@1.2.0       install an exact version instead of the latest
  llmsh install --dir ./skills   unpack somewhere specific

Environment:
  LLMSH_API       default https://api.llmskillhub.com
  LLMSH_INGEST    default https://api.llmskillhub.com
  LLMSH_TOKEN     a token, for CI, instead of the stored one
